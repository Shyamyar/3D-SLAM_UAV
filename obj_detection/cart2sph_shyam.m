function [polar,elev_xy] = cart2sph_shyam(cart)
%CART2SPH Transform Cartesian to spherical coordinates.
%   [POLAR,ELEV_XY] = CART2SPH_SHYAM(CART) transforms corresponding elements of
%   data stored in Cartesian coordinates CART = [X,Y,Z] to spherical
%   coordinates POLAR = [TH,PHI,R](azimuth TH, elevation PHI, and radius
%   R). The arrays X,Y, and Z must be the same size (or any of them can
%   be scalar). TH and PHI are returned in radians.
%   
%   There is a another output argument called ELEV_XY that gives the angle
%   of landmark from XY plane considering a plane passing through the
%   landmark and Y-axis. This is for comparing to FOV in Elevation.
%
%   TH is the counterclockwise angle in the xy plane measured from the
%   positive x axis.  PHI is the elevation angle from the xy plane.
